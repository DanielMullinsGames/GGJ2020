Easy Ropes 2D Extras Version 1.4.5

-> 	Example Folder Contains Five Example Scenes:
		* 00_SimpleScene
		* 01_SlingScene
		* 02_BridgeScene
		* 03_KnifeScene
		* 04_PulleyScene
		
->	Inside this folder you can find KnifeCutter Systems.

->	If you want to delete all scenes and just leave the Main Rope Assets as example you can delete all folders inside "Example" excluding the folder with name "_MainRopePrefabs".
		
ps:  Dont Forget to add scenes to BuildSetting because 'NextSceneButton' and 'PreviousSceneButton' need this scenes in Build.
